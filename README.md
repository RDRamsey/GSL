The file MCD43A4_20200101-20201231_Max75.gif is an animated GIF showing the daily changes in Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations across the Great Salt Lake, Utah spanning 2020.
The Chl-a concentrations were modeled using MODIS MCD43A4 daily cloud-free imagery coupled with field estimates of Chl-a.
